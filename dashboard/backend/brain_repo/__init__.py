"""Brain Repo — GitHub-based versioning for workspace memory and customizations.

Import-time API-contract check
------------------------------
``routes/brain_repo.py`` assumes specific symbols and signatures from this
package. When they drift (module renamed, function signature changed, keyword
arg missing) the old behaviour was to fall through to an `except ImportError`
branch in the routes, which silently stored PAT tokens as plaintext and
returned generic "restore module not yet available" messages — bugs that
slipped past reviewers because they never surfaced at startup.

This block runs ``inspect.signature`` on the critical APIs and logs a WARNING
if they diverge. The warning is visible in startup logs so future regressions
can be caught before they reach production. Assertions are soft (log only)
because we don't want a typo to crash the entire app — a warning with the
exact divergence is enough signal.
